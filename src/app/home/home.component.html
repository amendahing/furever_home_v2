    <h2>Volunteer</h2>
    <p>Volunteers are vital to operations at the Hayward Animal Shelter. There are many ways you can help us humanely care for
      and place the more than 3,700 animals that come through the shelter each year. </p>

    <h2>Spay/Neuter</h2>
    <p>An estimated 5 million cats and dogs are euthanized in shelters each year. There are not enough homes for all the unwanted
      pets that are born, so spaying and neutering your pets can alleviate pet overpopulation.
